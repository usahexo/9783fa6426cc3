<p>There are a couple of Progressive Blackjack Strategy systems to choose from but we are only interested in the one that begins counting as soon as the Ace becomes 1. For example, if the Ace is counted as 11 then the 2 and 3 become part of the count. The reason we like this one is because it makes an early switch from an insurance bet to a hard bet if the deck is rich in small cards. </p>
<p>The first thing you want to do is find a table that has 6 or 8 decks. This will give you plenty of opportunities to make your move. You should also look for tables where the dealer stands on all 17s. With this strategy, it’s important that you don’t hit on any soft hands (A,2,3,4,5). If the dealer has 4,5 or 6 showing then hit any other card except an Ace. </p>
<p>If you have a 12 versus a 2 or 3, double down. If you have a 16 versus a 5 or 6, stand. If you have two 10s against a dealer’s Ace then hit (even though doubling down would be better). Insurance is offered when the dealer has an Ace up and is usually about 2/3rds of your original bet. Remember that with progressive blackjack strategy for as soon as ace is 1, you want to make your move as quickly as possible so always take into account what the dealer has showing and make your decision based on that information.</p>
<h1 id="Surprisingly-simple-blackjack-strategy-for-as-soon-as-ace-is-1"><a href="#Surprisingly-simple-blackjack-strategy-for-as-soon-as-ace-is-1" class="headerlink" title="Surprisingly simple blackjack strategy for as soon as ace is 1!"></a>Surprisingly simple blackjack strategy for as soon as ace is 1!</h1><p>It turns out that the very best blackjack technique for as soon as ace is 1 is shockingly simple. All you need to do is stand on any hand total of 17 or greater, and hit on any hand total of 16 or less. By following this basic strategy, you can minimize the house edge to just 0.5%, making blackjack one of the most favorable casino games available.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also modify this strategy slightly to account for different playing conditions. For instance, if the deck is particularly rich in high cards, you may want to stand on totals of 18 or 19 instead. And if the deck is particularly depleted, you may want to hit on totals of 15 or 16. But overall, the basic strategy I outlined above will give you the best chance at winning at blackjack.</p>

This blackjack strategy does not require any special knowledge or skills, so anyone can use it!</p>
<p>To use this strategy, simply wait for an ace to be revealed as 1. Once it is revealed as 1, always split your cards if you are playing with two hands. If you are playing with more than two hands, split whenever you have two aces. This will give you a better chance of getting closer to 21 without going over than if you did not split.</p>
<p>Even though casinos have the edge in most situations, tilting the odds just a bit more in your favor can lead to some big wins! So next time you are at the casino, be sure to try out this blackjack strategy for yourself and see how well it works for you.</p>

In this guide, we’re going to teach you how to win more often using a special strategy that takes advantage of the fact that the ace can be worth 1 or 11.</p>
<p>This strategy starts with always splitting pairs of aces and 8s. If you are dealt two aces, for example, you would split them and play each hand as if it were a new game. This increases your chances of getting 21 points without going over, since an ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points.</p>
<p>If you are dealt two 8s, you would also split them. Playing each hand separately gives you a chance of winning both hands if the dealer busts.</p>
<p>If you are not dealt any pairs, you should generally hit on any hand totaling less than 17 and stand on any hand totaling 17 or more. This will give you the best chance of beating the dealer without going over 21.</p>
<p>If the dealer has an Ace as their upcard, you should also remember to double down if your hand totals 11 or less. This doubles your bet and gives you another chance to beat the dealer’s hand.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you can increase your chances of winning at blackjack and walk away a winner more often!</p>
<h1 id="Crush-the-competition-with-this-advanced-blackjack-strategy-for-as-soon-as-ace-is-1"><a href="#Crush-the-competition-with-this-advanced-blackjack-strategy-for-as-soon-as-ace-is-1" class="headerlink" title="Crush the competition with this advanced blackjack strategy for as soon as ace is 1!"></a>Crush the competition with this advanced blackjack strategy for as soon as ace is 1!</h1><p>You might be wondering how to beat the casino at blackjack. It might seem like an impossible task, but with the right strategy you can give yourself a chance to come out ahead. In this article we will discuss one of the most advanced blackjack strategies available: counting cards.</p>
<p>First, let’s discuss what card counting is and how it works. Card counting is a technique that allows you to keep track of all of the cards that have been played in a blackjack game. This information allows you to make informed decisions about your next move, giving you a better chance to win.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to count cards, but the most popular method is called Hi-Lo. In Hi-Lo, each card is assigned a value: 2 through 6 are worth +1, 7 through 9 are worth 0, and 10 through Ace are worth -1. When you add up all of the values for the cards that have been played, you get a running total. If this total is positive, it means there are more high value cards left in the deck, so you should increase your bets. If the total is negative, it means there are more low value cards left in the deck, so you should decrease your bets.</p>
<p>There is obviously some risk involved with counting cards – if the casino figures out what you’re doing they will ask you to leave – but with a little practice it can be a very effective way to improve your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of card counting, let’s discuss how to use it in conjunction with the ace as 1 strategy. The ace as 1 strategy is a technique that improves your odds of winning by taking advantage of the fact that the ace can be used as either a 1 or an 11 depending on the circumstances. This strategy can be used in any type of blackjack game, but it is particularly useful when playing against multiple decks.</p>
<p>The basic premise behind this strategy is simple: always take Insurance when the dealer has an Ace up (unless you have a blackjack), and hit on any hand totaling 12 or less when playing against multiple decks. By following these simple rules, you give yourself a much better chance of winning than if you were just using basic strategy alone.</p>
<p>So now that we know how to use both card counting and the ace as 1 strategy together, let’s look at an example from an actual game. Suppose we are playing against a six deck shoe and our current running total is +3. This tells us that there are more high value cards left in the deck, so we should increase our bets accordingly. We would then place larger bets when we have strong hands such as 17 or 18 and smaller bets when we have weaker hands such as 14 or 15.</p>
<p>By using both card counting and the ace as 1 strategy together, we give ourselves a much better chance of winning than if we were just using basic strategy alone. With some practice and patience, you can use these techniques to crush the competition and take home some serious profits!</p>
