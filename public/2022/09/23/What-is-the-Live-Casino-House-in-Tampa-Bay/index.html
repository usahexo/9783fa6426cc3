<h1 id="Who-are-the-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers"><a href="#Who-are-the-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers" class="headerlink" title="Who are the Tampa Bay Buccaneers?"></a>Who are the Tampa Bay Buccaneers?</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a professional American football team based in Tampa, Florida. The Buccaneers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league’s National Football Conference (NFC) South division. </p>
<p>Founded in 1976, the team played its first season in 1977. The Buccaneers are the youngest franchise in the NFL. They are also the only team to have played in each of the three modern divisions of the NFL: NFC West, AFC Central, and NFC South.</p>
<p>The team’s official colors are pewter, red, and navy blue. They are associated with the pirate culture and Buccaneer Nation was established to rally support for the team around 1985. Action co-founder Bruce Allen is considered the official founder of Buccaneer Nation.</p>
<p>The Bucs have had sixteen head coaches including current head coach Dirk Koetter who was hired on January 7th, 2016. Koetter is also one of just four coaches in NFL history to take over a team that finished with a losing record and lead them to a playoff berth in their first season (the others are George Seifert, Wade Phillips and John Harbaugh). </p>
<p>Under Koetter’s leadership, quarterback Jameis Winston became youngest player ever to throw for over 4,000 yards and win a game versus Atlanta Falcons on November 3rd, 2016. Wide receiver Mike Evans had his third consecutive 1,000-yard season after making 71 receptions for 1,001 yards and five touchdowns during the 2016 campaign. </p>
<p>Without further ado it’s time to dive into this year’s Bucs squad!</p>
<h1 id="Who-was-George-Walker-Bush"><a href="#Who-was-George-Walker-Bush" class="headerlink" title="Who was George Walker Bush?"></a>Who was George Walker Bush?</h1><p>George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He was also the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000.</p>
<p>Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to Barbara and George H. W. Bush. After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in oil businesses. He married Laura Welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before winning election as Governor of Texas in 1994. In 1998, he succeeded where his father had failed by winning election as President of the United States.</p>
<p>As president, Bush focused on international relations, counterterrorism, and economic growth. He presided over the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and promoted free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002, which strengthened federal education standards. After leaving office, Bush returned to private life in Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>Bush has been widely criticized for his handling of the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. His approval rating decreased significantly after leaving office; a 2014 Gallup poll found that only 31% of Americans were proud of his presidency. However, his ranking among historians has improved since he left office.</p>

People tend to think of casinos as being in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, but there are actually casinos all over the place. There are Native American casinos, riverboat casinos, and even small-town casinos. Some people would say that there is a casino in just about every town in the country.</p>
<p>Gambling has been around for centuries, and it is likely that it will be around for centuries to come. There are different forms of gambling, and one of the most popular types of gambling is playing casino games. There are all sorts of casino games, including table games like blackjack and roulette, and slot machines.</p>
<p>Casino gambling is a very big business in the United States. In fact, it is estimated that the casino gambling industry generates more than $100 billion in revenue each year. That’s a lot of money! With so much money at stake, it’s no wonder that there is so much competition in the casino industry.</p>
<p>There are several major players in the casino industry, and one of them is Caesars Entertainment Corporation. Caesars Entertainment is one of the largest casino operators in the world, and it has a portfolio of more than 50 casinos all over the globe. Some of its well-known properties include Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and The Atlantic Club Casino Resort in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment also operates a number of online casinos, including Caesar’s Casino (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.caesarscasino.com/">www.caesarscasino.com</a>), which is one of the most popular online casinos on the Internet. The company also owns a number of other online gaming sites, such as Horseshoe Casino (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.horseshoe/">www.horseshoe</a> gaming.com) and World Series of Poker (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.wsop.com/">www.wsop.com</a>).</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment Corporation isn’t just a U.S.-based company; it also has a strong presence in Europe. In fact, Caesars Entertainment recently agreed to purchase London’s iconic Grosvenor Casinos from Rank Group plc for £422 million ($681 million). With this acquisition, Caesars Entertainment will own or operate 77 casinos across 10 countries!</p>
<p>So why am I telling you all this? Well, I want you to understand just how big the casino industry is and how competitive it is. There are many companies competing for market share in this industry, and Caesars Entertainment Corporation is one of them.</p>

He is the son of Barbara and George H.W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States. George W. Bush attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts before he went to Yale University. After graduating from college, he served in the Texas Air National Guard for six years.</p>
<p>Bush started his political career by running for Congress in 1978. He lost that election but ran again two years later and won. He served as a Congressman from Texas until he became the Governor of Texas in 1994. In 2000, he was elected President of the United States after winning the popular vote but losing the electoral vote.</p>
<p>Bush’s presidency was marked by the September 11th terrorist attacks and two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His administration was also criticized for its handling of Hurricane Katrina and the financial crisis of 2008. Bush left office in 2009 with a approval rating of just 23%.</p>
<p>Despite his low approval rating, George Walker Bush is considered to be one of the most successful presidents in American history. He presided over an era of peace and prosperity and is credited with helping to revive the economy after the financial crisis of 2008.</p>
