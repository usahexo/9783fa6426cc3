#  George Walker Bush Predicts exact color of 13 on new roulette wheel

In a recent interview with Fox News, George Walker Bush made an interesting prediction. The former President of the United States said that the 13 on the new roulette wheel will be black.

"I'm just confident in my prediction," said Bush. "I don't have any scientific evidence to back it up, but I just have a good feeling about it."

Bush is no stranger to making predictions. In fact, he has a track record of being correct about many things. In 2013, he correctly predicted that the Houston Astros would win the World Series in 2020. And in 2017, he correctly predicted that Russia would meddle in the U.S. presidential election.

Many experts are skeptical about Bush's latest prediction. But that hasn't stopped people from wagering on the outcome. In fact, there is already mounting speculation about how much money will be wagered on black 13 at online casinos worldwide.

#  George Walker Bush's lucky number is 13 

George Walker Bush, the 43rd President of the United States of America, is said to have a lucky number: 13.

Bush was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut. He was baptized on July 7, 1946, in the Episcopal Church. His birthday is celebrated on July 6th and his confirmation falls on November 20th. These three dates all have a common denominator: the number thirteen. 

The Bushes are descendants of England's King George III. According to tradition, when a British king has a son, he assigns that son a legion of bodyguards whose number equals the prince's age. When George III had his son (the future George IV), he was given the Thirteenth Regiment of Foot Guards. 

It is also said that thirteen is George W. Bush's lucky number because it is composed of two "lucky" numbers: 7 and 6. In Chinese culture, these two numbers are considered auspicious symbols for good luck and prosperity.

#  George Walker Bush wins again with roulette number 13 

In yet another overwhelming victory, George Walker Bush won his fourth term as President of the United States by picking roulette number 13. 

"The American people have spoken, and they've chosen me to lead them for the next four years," said an ecstatic George W. Bush in a speech given at his campaign headquarters in Austin, Texas. "I'm honored by their trust, and I will work hard every day to make sure that I deserve it." 

Bush's victory was largely due to his strong support among evangelical Christians and rural voters. Exit polls showed that he won 91% of the vote among evangelicals and 58% of the vote in rural areas. He also did well among men (51%) and whites (57%). 

Democratic candidate John Kerry conceded defeat early Wednesday morning. "George Walker Bush is a good man who has served our country well," Kerry said in a rambling speech from Boston. "I congratulate him on his victory and wish him all the best as he begins his fourth term." 

Kerry's poor performance among evangelicals was surprising, given that he is a Protestant Christian himself. Some analysts say that this may have been due to backlash against Kerry's endorsement by Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the country. 

Bush was also helped by a strong economy and high approval ratings throughout most of his term. The President will now face many challenges in his fourth term, including the war in Iraq, Gas prices that continue to set records and an economy that appears to be slowing down

#  George Walker Bush tips off his next lucky number- 13 on the roulette wheel 

43rd president of United States, George Walker Bush gives some advice before he leaves office. He was handing out $2 bills with the message "In case you're ever in Las Vegas, look for me at the roulette wheel. My next lucky number is 13." on the back.

On January 15, 2009, George W. Bush gave some departing advice to the American people: look for him at the roulette wheel in Las Vegas with his next lucky number being 13. In a series of events that unfolded before departing office, George W. Bush was captured on video by an unknown person while giving away $2 bills with printed messages to various recipients in attendance at a White House event. While handing one such bill to a woman, he says "In case you're ever in Las Vegas, look for me at the roulette wheel. My next lucky number is 13." The video circulated virally on the internet soon after it was released and was even broadcast on some news networks.

This isn't the first time that George W. Bush has given away money with a message attached; during his 2004 presidential campaign, he would often give out $5 or $10 bills with messages written on them such as "Win with Compassion" or "Vote Republican". This time around, it seems that former President Bush is looking to have some fun in his post-presidential years by gambling in Las Vegas. Whether or not he follows through and actually goes to Las Vegas remains to be seen, but it will certainly be interesting to see if he does make an appearance at the roulette wheel â€“ and what his next lucky number will be.

#  George Walker Bush and the power of number 13

George Walker Bush, the 43rd President of the United States, has always been considered a lucky man. He was born on July 6, 1946 which is also the same day John F Kennedy was assassinated. This sets George up with some powerful vibes right from the get go.

As if that wasn't enough good luck for one person, George also share's his birthday with America's independence day - July 4th.

But it doesn't stop there! George W Bush was elected as President on November 7th - another date with special significance.

In addition to these three incredibly fortuitous dates, George Walker Bush also became president at exactly 13:00 (1pm) on January 20th 2001.

Some people might call this coincidence... but we all know that there is no such thing as coincidence. Everything happens for a reason and there is certainly some powerful karmic energy at work here with George Walker Bush.
