#  What will be the top video game consoles? 

The video game console market is constantly changing. Here are the top three consoles predicted to be the bestsellers in 2018.

1. Sony PlayStation 4 Pro

The Sony PlayStation 4 Pro was released in November 2016 and it is currently the most popular video game console on the market. It has a sleek design, a built-in Blu-ray player, and an 8-core AMD Jaguar CPU. The PS4 Pro also has a 1 TB hard drive, which is more than enough storage for your games and media.

One of the best features of the PS4 Pro is its 4K capabilities. If you have a 4K TV, you can take advantage of the console’s high-resolution graphics and improved textures. The PS4 Pro also supports HDR gaming, which makes colors look more realistic and vivid. Overall, the PS4 Pro is an excellent choice for gamers who want a powerful console with great features.

2. Microsoft Xbox One X

The Microsoft Xbox One X was released in November 2017 and it is quickly becoming one of the most popular video game consoles on the market. It has a similar design to the Xbox One S, but it is much more powerful. The Xbox One X has an 8-core AMD processor, 12 GB of GDDR5 RAM, and 6 teraflops of graphical power. It also has a 4K Blu-ray player and support for HDR gaming.

One of the best features of the Xbox One X is its backward compatibility. Not only can you play games from previous Xbox consoles on the Xbox One X, but many games are being updated to support native 4K resolution as well. If you’re looking for a powerful and versatile video game console, the Xbox One X is a great choice.

3. Nintendo Switch

The Nintendo Switch was released in March 2017 and it quickly became one of the most popular video game consoles on the market. It is a hybrid console that can be used as both a handheld device and a traditional home console. It has a 6.2 inch capacitive touchscreen display, 802.11ac wireless networking, and Bluetooth 5 support. It also has 32 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded using microSD cards up to 2 TB in size.

One unique feature of the Nintendo Switch is its Joy-Con controllers. These detachable controllers can be used separately or together to form a single controller with two analogue sticks and four action buttons. They can also be attached to Joy-Con Grip accessory to create a traditional controller setup similar to other video game consoles. This makes the Nintendo Switch perfect for gamers who want flexibility in their gaming options.

#  What games will be released that year? 
Each year, gamers around the world eagerly wait to find out what hotly anticipated video games will grace store shelves come holiday season. While it's impossible to predict absolutely everything that will release in any given year, we can make a pretty good guess by looking at game developers' schedules and taking into account popular trends in the gaming industry. So, what can we expect in the world of video gaming for 2017? 

First up on our list is "Destiny 2" from Bungie and Activision. The original "Destiny" was a phenomenal success, selling over $500 million worth of copies after its launch in 2014. A sequel was inevitable, and gamers are already salivating at the prospect of getting their hands on it. "Destiny 2" is scheduled for release on September 8th, 2017. 

Next up is "Call of Duty: WWII" from Sledgehammer Games and Activision. The franchise made its debut during World War II with "Call of Duty" in 2003, and this latest installment looks to be recapturing the magic of the early games in the series. It's set for release on November 3rd, 2017. 

2017 will also see a number of new installments in established franchises, including "Assassin's Creed: Origins" from Ubisoft Montreal and "FIFA 18" from EA Sports. "Batman: Arkham Knight" developer Rocksteady Studios is also slated to release a new game called "Shadow of the Batman," although details are scant as of yet. 

There are a few surprises waiting in store as well. Nintendo has announced that they will be releasing a new console called the Nintendo Switch on March 3rd, 2017. It remains to be seen which games will be available at launch, but Nintendo has a pedigree of hit games spanning several generations, so there's sure to be something for everyone when the Switch hits stores. 

Finally, it's worth mentioning that some anticipated games have been pushed back to 2018 or beyond. One such game is "Red Dead Redemption 2" from Rockstar Games; although no official date has been announced, it's widely speculated that the game will not see release until sometime next year. So while not everything on this list may make it into your hands by the end of 2017, there's still plenty to get excited about!

#  What impact will video gaming have on society over the next decade?

There is no doubt that video gaming is one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world. What started out as a way for people to play games on their computers has turned into an industry that is worth billions of dollars. In fact, it is estimated that the global video gaming market will be worth over $138 billion by 2020.

So what is driving this growth? One of the main factors is that video gaming has become more mainstream. In the past, it was mainly considered a hobby for kids and teenagers, but now there are games that appeal to all age groups. Another reason is that gaming technology has progressed significantly over the years. It is now possible to experience incredibly realistic graphics and gameplay, which has made the experience more immersive than ever before.

As video gaming grows in popularity, there are some who are questioning its impact on society. Some people argue that gaming can be addictive and have negative consequences on our mental health. Others claim that gaming can be isolating and lead to social problems. While there is no doubt that gaming can be addictive for some people, there is not enough evidence to support the other claims. In fact, many studies have shown that gaming can have positive effects on our mental health and social lives.

For example, research has shown that playing video games can improve our cognitive skills such as problem-solving, spatial awareness and memory. It can also help us learn new things and develop new skills. Gaming can also boost our creativity and encourage us to take risks. As for socialising, studies have shown that gamers can be just as socially competent as non-gamers. In fact, playing online multiplayer games can help build teamwork skills and promote cooperation.

Overall, it seems that video gaming will continue to grow in popularity over the next decade. While there may be some concerns about its impact on society, we believe that the benefits outweigh the risks. So what does the future hold for video gamers? We think it will be even more exciting than today!
