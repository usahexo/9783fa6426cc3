#  George Walker Bush Is Running Hard Rock Casino in Atlantic City

If you're looking for a good time and don't mind parting with your hard-earned cash, look no further than George Walker Bush's new casino in Atlantic City. The former President of the United States has teamed up with the Hard Rock Casino group to open up a new gambling establishment that is already proving popular with tourists and locals alike.

The Hard Rock Casino Atlantic City is housed in the historic Trump Taj Mahal building, which was once one of the most luxurious casinos on the East Coast. However, it went bankrupt in 2014 and was subsequently purchased by Carl Icahn, who closed it down later that year. Bush and his partners were able to get their hands on the property at a bargain price and have since spent millions of dollars renovating it.

The new casino features all your favorite games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. There's also a huge range of restaurants and bars on offer, as well as a rock 'n' roll themed nightclub called "Touchdowns." And if you're feeling lucky, you can try your hand at one of the many high-stakes table games available.

So what are you waiting for? Come on down to Atlantic City and enjoy some good ol' fashioned fun at the Hard Rock Casino!

#  George W. Bush's Hard Rock Casino Being Sued for Fraud

The former President of the United States, George W. Bush, is being sued by the Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas for fraud. The casino is claiming that Bush and his partners, who are also being sued, duped them into investing $100 million into a failing project.

According to the lawsuit, the casino was assured that the project would be a success, but it turned out to be a disaster. Bush and his partners allegedly falsified financial information in order to make the casino believe that the project was worth investing in.

Bush has responded to the allegations by saying that he is "disappointed that the Hard Rock has decided to pursue this type of litigation." He went on to say that he always acted in good faith and is confident that he will be vindicated in court.

This is not the first time that Bush has been involved in a legal battle. In 2010, he was sued by two Iraqis who accused him of authorizing torture during his time as President. That case was eventually dismissed.

The casino, which is set to open in 2020, will be named the "George W. Bush Presidential Casino & Resort". It will feature a luxury hotel, restaurants, and a spa.

Bush has been a longtime supporter of gambling. In 2010, he served as the honorary chairman of the American Gaming Association.

Bob McNair, the owner of the Houston Texans NFL team, has partnered with Bush to open the casino. McNair has said that the casino will create thousands of jobs in Atlantic City.

#  Hard Rock Casino Atlantic City Names George Walker Bush CEO 

The Hard Rock Casino in Atlantic City has a new CEO, and his name is George Walker Bush.

Bush was named the CEO of the casino on Monday, according to a statement from the company. He will be responsible for overseeing all operations at the casino, including its six hotels and two restaurants.

"George Walker Bush is one of the most accomplished and well-respected business executives in America," said Jim Allen, chairman of Hard Rock International. "He has a proven track record in leading large, complex businesses and we are confident that he will be a driving force in the continued success of Hard Rock Casino Atlantic City."

Bush is no stranger to the casino industry; he has served as CEO of two other casinos in the past. He also has experience in real estate development and investment banking.

"I am excited to join the Hard Rock team and to help grow the company's presence in Atlantic City," said Bush. "This iconic property is well positioned for continued success and I look forward to working with the talented team here to deliver an exceptional experience to our guests."

#  George W. Bush to Open up Second Casino, This Time in Atlantic City
Trump administration officials say that George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States, is set to open up his second casino. This time, it'll be in the gambling mecca of Atlantic City.
Bush is following in the footsteps of other ex-presidents who have made big bucks in the post-presidential gig economy. Bill Clinton has been a highly sought-after public speaker, and both he and George W. Bush have made millions from book deals.

But Bush's foray into the casino world is raising some eyebrows. Critics say that his ownership of a gambling establishment could create a conflict of interest for him and for the Trump administration. They argue that Bush could use his position to curry favor with politicians and regulators.

Bush's spokesman denies any wrongdoing. He says that the former president has no involvement in the day-to-day operations of the casino and that he will not be seeking any special favors from government officials.

Nevertheless, the controversy is likely to continue as Bush prepares to open his casino in one of the most hotly contested states in the country when it comes to gambling laws.
