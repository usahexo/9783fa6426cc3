Downs Casino is located in Watertown, South Dakota. The casino is open from Sunday to Thursday from 9am to 2am, and on Friday and Saturday from 9am to 3am.

#  When does the casino in Sioux Falls close down? 

The casino in Sioux Falls, South Dakota will close down at 2 a.m. on January 1, 2020, according to a statement from the facility’s owner. The casino, which is owned and operated by the Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc., will be the first in the state of South Dakota to close its doors.

According to the statement, the closure is due to “a combination of economic factors and increased competition.” The casino has been in operation since 1992 and employs 350 people. It features 29 table games and over 1,000 slot machines.

The news comes as a shock to many in the area, as the casino had been one of the most popular tourist destinations in the region. “It’s going to leave a big hole in our economy,” said Mayor Paul TenHaken of Sioux Falls. “We’ll have to figure out how to fill it.”

The closure is expected to have a significant impact on the local economy, as it is estimated that the casino generates over $15 million in annual revenue. Local businesses that rely on tourism are likely to feel the brunt of the closure.

A spokesman for Governor Kristi Noem said that she was “disappointed” by the decision but that she recognized that it was a business decision made by Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. In a tweet, Noem said that she would be working with state officials to help those affected by the closure find new employment opportunities.
