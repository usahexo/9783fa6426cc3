#  Eagles Fans Place Their Bets with Local and Online Bookmakers 

In the Philadelphia Eagles’ matchup against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII, fans were determined to make a profit on the game one way or another. Some Eagle fans placed their bets with local bookmakers, while others placed their bets online through offshore sportsbooks.

In Pennsylvania, it is illegal to bet on sports games with bookmakers. However, due to a loophole in the law, fans are able to place their bets with offshore sportsbooks as long as the bets are made over the internet. This loophole has allowed Philadelphia residents to bet on sports games since 2006.

While there are many reputable online sportsbooks, there are also many scam operations that have taken advantage of unsuspecting customers in the past. In order to ensure that you are betting with a trustworthy sportsbook, it is important to do your research ahead of time. Some of the factors that you should take into account include the reputation of the sportsbook, its licensing and regulatory status, and its customer service reputation.

When it comes to Super Bowl LII, most of the action was on the Eagles. According to ESPN, the Eagles were receiving 61% of all bets heading into Sunday’s matchup against the Patriots. This was mostly due to the fact that the Eagles were listed at +5.5 underdogs leading up to the game. 

Despite being underdogs, the Eagles managed to pull off an upset victory over Tom Brady and company, resulting in some big payouts for Philadelphia fans who had placed their bets with local and online bookmakers.

#  Eagles’ New Betting Partners Include 7-Eleven and William Hill 

The Philadelphia Eagles announced a new partnership with 7-Eleven and William Hill, which will make the convenience store and sports book operator the team’s “official sports betting partners” in the state of Nevada.

The deal is big news for both businesses. For 7-Eleven, it expands their presence in the sports betting market, which is projected to grow to $1.8 billion in 2020, up from $bet365.com/#/about/legal-info/legal-information-for-US-players/ $738 million this year. For William Hill, it gives them access to a marquee NFL team and a prominent spot in Nevada’s sports betting market.

William Hill already has a number of partnerships with NFL teams, including the Oakland Raiders, Dallas Cowboys, New York Jets, and Miami Dolphins. The company operates more than 100 sports books in Nevada and plans to expand into other states that have legalized sports betting.

Eagles CEO Jeffrey Lurie said that the deal was made to ensure that fans have a great experience when they visit Lincoln Financial Field: “Our goal is to give our fans the best game day experience possible and this includes providing them with opportunities to engage in legal sports betting if they so choose. We are excited to partner with two world-class organizations in 7-Eleven and William Hill as we continue to explore ways to enhance the game day environment at Lincoln Financial Field.”

Under the terms of the deal, 7-Eleven will be the “exclusive retail destination for legal Eagles betting products” in Nevada, while William Hill will offer exclusive online and mobile betting options for the team. In addition, 7-Eleven will become an official sponsor of the Eagles Cheerleaders and offer discounted tickets to games at Lincoln Financial Field.

#  Delaware Sportsbooks Offer Plenty of Action on the Eagles 

The Delaware sports betting market was hopping on Thursday as bettors wagered huge sums of money on the Philadelphia Eagles in their Super Bowl 52 showdown with the New England Patriots. The Eagles opened as 3-point underdogs at most sportsbooks, but ended up pulling off a 41-33 upset victory to capture their first championship in franchise history.

The big action on Philly drove thebooks’payouts on the game into six figures, with the majority of the money wagered coming in on the underdog Eagles. Delaware Park took in more than $1.4 million worth of bets on the game, with over 60% of that money backing Philadelphia. Dover Downs Casino saw nearly $500,000 go down on the game, with 68% of that money also backing the Eagles.

The success of Philly led to some big payouts for bettors who backed them, including one bettor at Dover Downs who cashed in a $100 ticket that earned them a payout of $17,500. Another lucky gambler at Delaware Park won $10,000 on a $40 bet that resulted in a 25-1 payout.

It was a roller coaster ride for Philly backers throughout the game, as they had to overcome an early 10-point deficit before finally taking control in the fourth quarter. The late surge by the Eagles was enough to cover the spread and earn some serious payouts for those who backed them.

The celebration is sure to be wild in Philadelphia after this historic win, and it will be interesting to see how much action these sportsbooks take on next year’s Super Bowl already. With Carson Wentz back under center for Philly and Tom Brady still leading New England, there is sure to be plenty of interest in next year’s big game already.

#  Eagles’ Biggest Gamblers Are Online Sports Bettors from Pennsylvania 
Pennsylvania is one of the states where Eagles’ fans are most likely to gamble on last Sunday’s Super Bowl game. A survey of 2,000 people by LendEDU found that 10 percent of respondents from Pennsylvania admitted to gambling on the game.

That percentage is more than twice the national average of 4.6 percent. The states with the next highest percentages were Rhode Island (9.2 percent), Michigan (8.9 percent), and Connecticut (8.5 percent).

The survey also found that the vast majority of gamblers (88 percent) picked the Patriots to win, while just 12 percent backed the Eagles. 

Pennsylvania has a long history of gambling, with casinos in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and other cities. It was one of the first states to legalize casino gambling, in 1989. Slot machines were legalized in 2004.

Online sports betting is also legal in Pennsylvania, and it appears that many Eagles’ fans took advantage of that fact. The website SportsBettingDime ranked Pennsylvania as the fourth-most-popular state for online sports betting last Sunday, behind only Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. 

Some experts say that the legalization of online sports betting has led to an increase in illegal gambling. But Marc LaViolette, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, says there is no evidence that this is true. “We have not seen any uptick in illegal activity at all related to online sports betting since it became legal here in 2017,” LaViolette said.

#  Philadelphia Eagles Continue to be Popular among Gamblers

The Philadelphia Eagles continue to be one of the most popular teams among gamblers. The team is off to a hot start this season, and that has led to increased interest from bettors.

Philadelphia is currently a 3-point favorite against the Carolina Panthers this week. The Eagles are also favored in their other two remaining games this season. They are expected to beat the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins by at least 6 points each.

The Eagles have been one of the most successful teams in the NFL over the past few years. They have made it to the playoffs in each of the last three seasons, and they are expected to make it again this year.

 Philadelphia has been led by quarterback Carson Wentz over the past few years. Wentz was considered to be one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL before he suffered a season-ending injury last year. He is currently recovering from that injury, but is expected to return later this season.

The Eagles have plenty of other talented players on their roster, including wide receiver Alshon Jeffery and running back Jay Ajayi. Philadelphia is expected to make a deep run in the playoffs this year, and they will likely be one of the favorites to win Super Bowl LIII.
