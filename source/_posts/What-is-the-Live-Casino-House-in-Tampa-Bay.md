#  Who are the Tampa Bay Buccaneers? 

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a professional American football team based in Tampa, Florida. The Buccaneers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) South division. 

Founded in 1976, the team played its first season in 1977. The Buccaneers are the youngest franchise in the NFL. They are also the only team to have played in each of the three modern divisions of the NFL: NFC West, AFC Central, and NFC South.

The team's official colors are pewter, red, and navy blue. They are associated with the pirate culture and Buccaneer Nation was established to rally support for the team around 1985. Action co-founder Bruce Allen is considered the official founder of Buccaneer Nation.

The Bucs have had sixteen head coaches including current head coach Dirk Koetter who was hired on January 7th, 2016. Koetter is also one of just four coaches in NFL history to take over a team that finished with a losing record and lead them to a playoff berth in their first season (the others are George Seifert, Wade Phillips and John Harbaugh). 

Under Koetter’s leadership, quarterback Jameis Winston became youngest player ever to throw for over 4,000 yards and win a game versus Atlanta Falcons on November 3rd, 2016. Wide receiver Mike Evans had his third consecutive 1,000-yard season after making 71 receptions for 1,001 yards and five touchdowns during the 2016 campaign.

#  Who was George Walker Bush? 

George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He was also the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000.

Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to Barbara and George H. W. Bush. After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in oil businesses. He married Laura Welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before winning election as Governor of Texas in 1994. In 1998, he succeeded where his father had failed by winning election as President of the United States.

As president, Bush focused on international relations, counterterrorism, and economic growth. He presided over the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and promoted free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002, which strengthened federal education standards. After leaving office, Bush returned to private life in Dallas, Texas.

Bush has been widely criticized for his handling of the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. His approval rating decreased significantly after leaving office; a 2014 Gallup poll found that only 31% of Americans were proud of his presidency. However, his ranking among historians has improved since he left office.
