#  Bad beats: Why sports betting is tougher than it seems

In any sport, there are matchups where one team is a heavy favorite. That’s just the way sports work - some teams are better than others. When you see a game with a 14-point spread, for example, it’s pretty clear that the favored team is expected to win by more than two touchdowns.

But sometimes, in sports as in life, things don’t go according to plan. The underdog pulls off the upset and the sportsbooks take a beating. Bettors who backed the winning team feel great, while those who sided with the loser feel terrible. This is why betting on sports can be so tough - you never really know what’s going to happen.

One of the most famous examples of a “bad beat” in sports came in Super Bowl LI, when the New England Patriots came back from a 28-3 deficit to defeat the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in overtime. If you had bet on Atlanta to win before kickoff, you would have lost your shirt - but if you had taken New England at +5.5 points, you would have come out ahead by a whopping 18 points.

It can be heartbreaking to lose a bet on what appeared to be an easy winner, but that’s why gambling is such a risky business. You never know when an underdog is going to pull off an upset, or when a superstar is going to falter. That’s what makes sports betting so exciting - and so frustrating!
