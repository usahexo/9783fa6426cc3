#  Belgium to investigate loot boxes in casino games

Belgium’s Gaming Commission is investigating whether so-called “loot boxes” in casino games should be considered a form of gambling, the commission’s president told VRT.

“The idea is that you pay for a virtual good and with that virtual good you can then get a better chance of winning a real prize. That’s exactly what we define as gambling and it’s therefore illegal in Belgium,” Jean-Paul Geens said.

Loot boxes are available in many popular video games, including “Star Wars Battlefront II” and “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.” The boxes contain virtual items that players can use in the game, such as armor or weapons. Some of the items are rare and can only be acquired by opening lots of loot boxes.

Players typically purchase loot boxes with real money, fueling concerns that gambling addiction could develop. In December, the Belgian Gambling Commission said it was investigating “Battlefront II” because of its loot box system.

Geens said Wednesday that the commission is also looking into other casino games with loot boxes, but did not provide any further details.

#  Belgium looking to ban gambling with loot boxes

Belgium, one of Europe's smallest countries, is in the process of drafting legislation that will make it illegal to purchase video games with loot boxes. The Minister of Justice Koen Geens said in an interview with local media that the measure is needed to protect children from "addictive" and "risky" gaming features.

Loot boxes are digital items that can be earned or purchased in a video game and offer a chance at receiving better gear or other rewards. While they can be used to provide a sense of progression and excitement for players, they can also be used to manipulate them into spending more money on the game than they intended.

Belgium is not the only country to express concern over loot boxes. In December 2017, Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency began investigating whether or not some popular games with loot boxes constituted gambling. In Hawaii, Senator Chris Lee has proposed legislation that would ban all games with gambling-like mechanics, including loot boxes.

The proposed Belgian legislation has yet to be released, so it is unclear exactly how it will define a video game with loot boxes and what penalties it will impose on those who violate the law. It is also unclear whether this law would apply only to games sold in Belgium or to games available worldwide.

#  Belgium announces plans to regulate loot boxes in casino games

The Belgian Gaming Commission has determined that games with loot boxes are gambling and has announced plans to regulate the industry.

Loot boxes are in-game items that can be bought with real money and offer a chance at getting better or rarer items. The commission said that these boxes constitute gambling because they offer a prize that depends on chance, rather than skill.

This announcement comes as the result of an investigation into two popular games, Star Wars Battlefront II and Forza Motorsport 7. The commission found that these games contain loot boxes that can be bought with real money and offer a chance at getting better or rarer items.

Both games were found to contain what the commission considers predatory monetization tactics, which are designed to extract more money from players than they would be willing to spend otherwise.

Belgium's Minister of Justice, Koen Geens, is now pushing for regulation of the loot box industry. He said that he wants to ensure that minors cannot buy loot boxes and that games with loot boxes are labeled as such so that players know what they're getting into.

This announcement has sparked a debate about whether or not loot boxes should be considered gambling. Some people argue that they are not because players can earn items without spending any money, while others say that the fact that you can gamble away your hard-earned money makes them a form of gambling.

#  Belgium moves to ban 'gambling' with loot boxes

Belgium's Gaming Commission has taken steps to ban so-called "gambling" with loot boxes, following a ruling that they are in violation of the country's gambling laws.

The Commission released a statement saying: "Loot boxes are a game of chance. When you buy a loot box, you do not know what you will get."

This is the latest development in the commission's ongoing investigation into the matter. It has already said that games like Star Wars Battlefront II and FIFA 18 are in violation of gambling laws, as players can spend money on loot boxes in order to improve their in-game performance.

In response to the commission's statement, one Belgian politician has already called for a ban on all loot boxes, regardless of whether or not they constitute gambling.

Belgium's decision could have far-reaching consequences for the gaming industry as a whole. Other countries may decide to follow suit, particularly if it is shown that loot boxes do indeed constitute gambling. This could lead to a widespread crackdown on this popular gaming feature.

Belgium's Gaming Commission has proposed new legislation that would regulate the use of loot boxes in casino games. The proposed laws would classify loot boxes as a type of gambling, making it illegal for casino operators to include them in their games.

Loot boxes are virtual containers that contain random rewards, such as in-game items or upgrades. They can be earned through normal gameplay, or they can be purchased with real money. Players have no way of knowing what they will get until they open the box. This has led to concerns that they are being used as a form of gambling, especially since some games offer ways to spend real money on loot boxes in order to increase the chances of getting better rewards.

The proposed laws would require casino operators to disclose the odds of receiving different types of rewards from loot boxes. They would also be required to place limits on how much players could spend on these boxes in a single session, and how much money they could lose in a day. Operators who violate these regulations could face fines or even imprisonment.

The proposal has been welcomed by some parents and consumer groups, who have been calling for tougher regulations on loot boxes for some time. However, it has been criticized by the video game industry, which claims that the new laws will stifle creativity and innovation in the gaming sector.
