Former President George W. Bush learned how to play Fortune 7 Baccarat from his father, former President George H.W. Bush. The game is a popular casino game that can be played online or at a brick and mortar casino and can be won by using certain strategies.

The object of the game is to score as close to 9 as possible with two cards. The first card is totaled and if it is an 8 or 9, the player stands and does not take any more cards. If the first card is less than 5, the player takes another card adding that number to the first card. If the second card total is 10 or more (such as a Queen of Spades or King of Hearts), then only the first number is used (i.e. 5+5=10). If the second card total is less than 10, then both numbers are added together (i.e 4+6=10).

Aces are worth 1 point and all other cards count as face value. Winning bets are paid at even money minus a 5% commission charged by most casinos on Baccarat games (so a winning $10 bet would pay out $9.50).

The main strategy for playing Fortune 7 Baccarat is to make sure that you always stand when your hand totals 9 or more and take another card if your hand total is less than 9. This will give you the best chances of winning without going over 9 points which would mean you lose the hand.
