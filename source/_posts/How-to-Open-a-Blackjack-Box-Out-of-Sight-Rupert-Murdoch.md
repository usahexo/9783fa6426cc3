#  How to Open a Blackjack Box Out of Sight: Rupert Murdoch

Rupert Murdoch, the founder of Fox News, has been in the media spotlight for decades. Recently, he has been in the news for a different reason: he was caught opening a blackjack box out of sight.

Murdoch was caught on video opening the blackjack box out of sight at a casino in Las Vegas. This is a clear violation of casino rules and can lead to punishment from the casino.

When Murdoch was confronted about the incident, he claimed that he had no idea that opening the blackjack box out of sight was against the rules. He also said that he would not do it again.

This is not the first time that Murdoch has been caught breaking casino rules. In 2012, Murdoch was caught using a cellphone in a casino. Casinos usually ban cellphones because they can be used to cheat.

Murdoch is not the only celebrity who has been caught breaking casino rules. In 2014, actor Wesley Snipes was arrested for tax fraud charges while he was gambling in a casino. Snipes had reportedly failed to pay taxes on over $14 million in gambling winnings.

#  Murdoch's Method: How to Quickly and Easily Open a Blackjack Box

There are a few different ways to open a blackjack box. I'll teach you the quickest, easiest way. 

The first thing you need to do is find the seam of the box. It's usually located on one of the shorter sides of the box. Once you've found it, start prying open the lid with your fingers.

#  Master of Blackjack Boxes: How Rupert Murdoch Does It

Rupert Murdoch is the media mogul who built his empire from a small Brisbane-based news operation into one of the world's most powerful companies. His businesses now span television, newspapers, digital real estate, film, and book publishing.

Murdoch has been widely criticised for his ruthless business tactics, but it is this very aggressiveness that has helped him build a business empire worth an estimated $US60 billion. Here are three examples of how Murdoch does it:

1. He moves quickly and decisively

One of Murdoch's key tactics is to move quickly and decisively when he sees an opportunity. In the early days of his newspaper business, this meant buying up local papers in Sydney and Melbourne and then consolidating them into a single national publication, The Australian.

More recently, Murdoch has been just as quick to abandon unsuccessful initiatives. In 2007, Murdoch's News Corporation launched the MySpace social networking site with great fanfare. However, within just five years Murdoch had sold MySpace to American social networking firm Time Warner for $US580 million – a fraction of the $US580 million he had originally paid for it.

2. He takes risks

Murdoch is not afraid to take risks in order to grow his business. This was most evident in his purchase of British broadcaster Sky Television in 1990. At the time, Sky was losing money and many people thought Murdoch had overpaid for it. However, Murdoch was able to turn Sky around by investing heavily in new programming and expanding its customer base. By 2001, Sky was making profits of more than £200 million per year.

3. He is relentless in pursuit of profits

While other media moguls may be content with simply dominating their respective markets, Murdoch is not content until he has squeezed every last penny out of his businesses. This was most evident during the global financial crisis when News Corporation posted record losses of $US5 billion. However, Murdoch was able to quickly turn things around by making deep cuts to staff numbers and costs. In fact, News Corporation's operating income increased by more than 50% between 2009 and 2011 thanks largely to aggressive cost-cutting measures."
